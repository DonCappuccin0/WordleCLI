# WordleCLI
A Java based Wordle game made without third-party dependencies.

### What are the rules of Wordle ?
Wordle is a simple game in which you have to guess a word. You have limited guesses, learning a little more information with each guess, and eventually narrow your guesses down to find the answer. Or at least that's the theory â€“ because while it is a simple game at heart, it's sometimes surprisingly tricky to find the solution. 

> *The word length and number of tries are chosen when you create the Worlde object in the main method.*

___

The game also keeps track of :
- Available letters
- Number of tries
- Right and wrong positions of each letter

### What would I like to improve in the game's code ?
- [ ] Use the stream API
- [ ] Check if a word exists in the english lexicon
- [ ] Add a graphical user interface
